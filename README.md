We will be modeling and engineering data which contain employee personal information, information of salary, titles and departments.  Later, we will analyze the data to gain insights and inform management for strategic decision making.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard to prepare for the near future in two ways.  First, knowing which employees qualify for retirement packages and be able to include them in the budget.  Second, to plan recruitment by getting to know which positions will need to be filled in the near future by department as the number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings.

### Current situation:
Pewlett Hackard is a mature company with several thousand employees.  Itâ€™s baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate and management is looking into the near future to provide retirement packages, asses recruitment needs, and create a mentorship program in which employees who are about to retire mentor new hires.

### Overview of spproach:
We had originally six large csv files; salaries, employees, managers by department, employees by department, titles, and departments.  We used a tool called Quick Database Diagrams to stablish the connections in between the different files by making conceptual, logical, and pysical entity relationship diagrams (ERD).  Later, we used PostgreSQL, a free and open-source relational database management system (RDMS), to create Hewlett Packard's employee database.  Finally, by writing SQL queries, we created, joined, & sorted, created four new tables; unique_titles, retiring_titles, retirement_titles, and mentorship_eligibility.  The main SQL functions used were: INNER JOINS, DISTINCT ON, CREATE TABLE,
