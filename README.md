# Employee Retirement Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Description:
In this project we helping Pewlett Hackard, a large mature company, to transition from storing and manage their employee data in VBA and Excel into SQL.  We will be modeling and engineering data which contain employee personal information, information of salary, titles and departments.  Later, we will analyze the data to gain insights and inform management for strategic decision making.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard to prepare for the near future in two ways.  First, knowing which employees qualify for retirement packages and be able to include them in the budget.  Second, to plan recruitment by getting to know which positions will need to be filled in the near future by department as the number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings.

### Current situation:
Pewlett Hackard is a mature company with several thousand employees.  Itâ€™s baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate and management is looking into the near future to provide retirement packages, asses recruitment needs, and create a mentorship program in which employees who are about to retire mentor new hires.

### Overview of approach:
We had originally six large csv files; salaries, employees, managers by department, employees by department, titles, and departments.  We used a tool called Quick Database Diagrams to stablish the connections in between the different files by making conceptual, logical, and pysical entity relationship diagrams (ERD).  Later, we used PostgreSQL, a free and open-source relational database management system (RDMS), to create Hewlett Packard's employee database.  Finally, by writing SQL queries, we created, joined, & sorted tables, used functions such as ORDER BY, COUNT, GROUP BY to create tailored lists for the analysis.  The initially given files plus the four new files created are stored in the Data folder.  The code used is stored in the file Employee_Database_challenge.sql inside the Queries folder.


## ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

**1. Roles to be filled:**




**2. Mentorship program:**

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

**3. More:**
 provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
